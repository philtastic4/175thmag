<i>Q: How would you characterize "milsim" from other online DCS squadrons? </i>
<p style="margin-top:1cm;">
A:  When we say Milsim we are referring to the fact that we like to put some order into the flight operations themselves in order to bring several positive things. By having briefings and some organized practice beforehand, we can take on progressively more complex and difficult missions without some slapdash attitude you might see in some other groups where things tend to fall apart and everyone is off doing their own thing. So I’d say the bottom line is we adopt Milsim characteristics where they serve us and make the flying more organized and effective. It’s not really a matter of LARPing, it’s a means to get more out of the sim by getting to the next level of efficiency as a group so that we can enjoy more challenging missions together. Outside of those instances, we are just a bunch of friends enjoying the hobby and behave as such too! We don’t want to give the impression that we are stuck up or anything, we also don’t want to give the impression that there isn’t a stroke of forethought and nothing gets done around here. We are trying to strike the balance between. The subterranean line underneath the bottom line is the truth that we are ultimately enjoying a hobby we all have, and it’s all supposed to be a good time. We wouldn’t put the effort into this organization if we didn’t want to be a part of it after all.

<p style="margin-top:2cm;">
<i>Q: Are 175th pilots required to address superior officers by "sir" and their respective ranks, etc.?</i>
<p style="margin-top:1cm;">
A: Absolutely not, the only sort of ranking we have here is recruit, member, and squad lead. There are no titles or suffixes for any of these, they are just for matters of organization and planning. Members get a few more privileges when they finish their recruit phase, mainly being that that get to participate in operations as opposed to being limited to trainings.  We are of the same opinion that the “stick up my ass, you had better call me sir when we play this video game” attitude is pretty silly and we are all here to have fun. That sort of thing isn’t where the Milsim attribute of our squadron comes from.
